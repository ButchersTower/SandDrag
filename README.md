SandDrag
=========

2d Vector Collision Detection.

Player is a circle with a radius, location (x, y), movement speed.

Walls are points (x, y) connected to eachother. If the angle two walls forms is less than or equal to 90 degreese it gets buggy.

Can only work with one building but easily adjustable.
